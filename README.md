## How It Works 🛠️

1. State Management: The app uses Riverpod to manage the dice state. The diceProvider is a StateNotifierProvider that updates the dice value when the "Roll" button is pressed.

2. Dynamic UI: The dice face is dynamically updated using the diceState value, which corresponds to the image file name in the assets/images directory.

3. Flutter Widgets: The app uses Flutter's ConsumerWidget to rebuild the UI whenever the dice state changes.
